			<summary>Tickets</summary>
				<h2><br>Wristbands</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The wristband tents are located just inside each campsite gate so you need to swap your ticket for a wristband before you enter the campsite and pitch your tent. </li>
				<li>Re-admittance to the site is only possible once you have got your wristband. Entrance to the arena is only possible with a valid wristband. There is no readmission on day tickets.</li>
				<li>Wristbands removed from the wrist or tampered with will be rendered invalid and will not be replaced.</li>
				<li>To avoid any disappointment we advise all ticket holders to leave plenty of time to get their wristband and allow time to walk to the arena and the stages to avoid missing any of your chosen acts.</li>
				<li>We advise all day ticket purchasers to arrive early to avoid missing any of their chosen acts and to leave ample time to get from the day arena entrance to the stages.</li>

				<h2>The Boutique Camping</h2>
			<p>Electric Picnic 2019 has a range of accommodation offerings. The amazing Pink Moon Village will be back for yet another year to please the thousands of Picnic fans with some great structures to go alongside the wonderful facilities which they offer.
			<br>If it is some of life’s finest luxuries you're after Harvest Moon (in the woods) could be exactly what you need this year, offering a brand new camping experience through some of the finest yurts you’re likely to see. If it’s a comfy lodge or spacious bell tent you would prefer, then the revamped boutique campsite, Harvest Moon Boutique, has just the thing for you.
			<br>Kip ‘n’ Go makes a return for a second year after a successful first outing in 2017 with its quick and easy camping alternative. Kip ‘n’ Go is the answer to one of the biggest issues festivals have to deal with – the left over tents! With a pre-pitched tent for 2 people ready and waiting for your arrival, and packed down after your departure, at only €7.5pp each night you are able to camp in comfort and help our environment. </p>

			<summary>The Arena</summary>
				<h2>Its more than music festival</h2>
			
				<ul>
				<li>Art: Explore a world of art and creation at Electric Picnic. Throughout the arena you will find sculptures and art work hidden in every nook and cranny. Over the years we have seen creations such as the Giant Gramaphone, Washing Machine Maze, Goat Mountain, The WyrdWood Vilage,  Fiddling Fox and Wicker People.</li>
				<li>Comedy Tent: Prepare yourself for a belly full of laughs as we provide you with some of the best established and up-and-coming comedians from around Ireland.</li>
				<li>Greencrafts:​The Greencrafts village is a brilliant place to spend a while changing gear and making something beautiful to take home. Specializing in traditional (or some say forgotten) crafts – the organisers Nic and Marie have brought together some of Ireland’s most exciting craft workshops, so you can choose from over forty things to make from silver rings, to wooden plates, felted scarves to iron pokers, slate pendants to willow baskets...and loads more. </li>
				<li>Global Green: On the edge of the Picnic you will discover the Global Green, the conscious heartbeat of Electric Picnic. It connects people to one another and creates a vision of possibilities, with engaging conversations, uplifting performances and food for the soul.</li>
				<li>Mindfield:​ The Mindfield spoken word arena boasts a stimulating spark-filled programme designed to entertain, inform and inflame. Set among the ancient trees on the lawns of Stradbally Hall you'll find an oasis of literary readings, political debate, performance poetry, science experiments, inspiring talks, news quizzes, public conversations and much more.  The Mindfield Arena invites us to fill our brains with new thoughts, ideas and experiences that we hope will engage and help inspire us to all be change makers.</li>
				<li>Theatre of Food: Located in the Mindfield arena of Electric Picnic, the Theatre of Food features a line-up of chefs, writers, thinkers, artisans, brewers, bakers, and food heroes.  It's a celebration of everything we love about food and drink - and music. Over the weekend you can expect food demonstrations, mixology, "Theatre of Food Tastes" treating the audience to delicious tastings of exciting foods almost every hour, talks, manifestos, food quizzes and much more.</li>
				<li>Fossett's Circus​: You will be transported into a world where aerialists defy death, jugglers defy gravity, acrobats defy description and the clowns simply defy everyone.</li>
